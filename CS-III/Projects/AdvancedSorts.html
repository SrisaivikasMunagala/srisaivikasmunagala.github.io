  <h1>Merge Sorts</h1>
  <p>Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that follows the divide and conquer approach. It works by dividing an unsorted list into smaller sublists, sorting these sublists, and then merging them back together to produce a sorted list. The idea is to repeatedly split the list until you have smaller pieces that are easier to sort and then combine them in a sorted way. Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst, average, and best cases, making it efficient for large datasets.</p>

  <h1>Quick Sort</h1>
  <p>Quicksort is another divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm known for its efficiency. It works by selecting a "pivot" element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, those less than the pivot and those greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted. Quicksort's time complexity is generally O(n log n) in the average case, which is highly efficient, but it can degrade to O(n^2) in the worst case if the pivot selection is not optimized. Quicksort is memory-efficient and has a space complexity of O(log n) due to its recursive nature.</p>
