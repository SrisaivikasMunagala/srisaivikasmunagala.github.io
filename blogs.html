    <h1>2-May-2023 topic: The death of the BYOD network</h1>
      <p>The removal of the BYOD network is unfair to the students. It's like the stupid IT department dont have lifes. I ain't trying to use those slow crapbooks. Also, we won't be able to use our phones. There campaign is called Empower 1:1 but those who dont have unlimited data are limited on the usage of their phone.</p>
