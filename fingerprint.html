    <p>HTTPS is an updated form of HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol). The S stands for secure. With society basically running on the internet from completing simple tasks to online banking, there is a necessity for encryption in sites that are important. The main purpose of HTTPS is to provide a secure, safe, and encrypted connection between client and server. It also ensures the user has privacy while using the website. Government entities, schools, and ISPs use a tool known as Proxy Appliance to decrypt all logs and data sent by the client. The client has to go through the Proxy Appliance to connect to the internet.

    <p>A Man in the Middle Attack (MITM) is a term utilized for when an unknown attacker goes in the middle of a transfer of data between the server and client. This can be utilized to steal confidential information such as bank account info, medical records, login credentials, etc. This can be done by intercepting a transfer and decrypting the data. There are various methods for decrypting data such as IP spoofing, SSL hijacking, and ARP spoofing. A hash is a complex mathematical algorithm that processes all the data that it receives. A good hash is one that is efficient in processing the data as well as having the least bugs possible.</p>
    <p>A certificate authority (CA) is an establishment for the website owners to prove their identity. After proving identity, the sites security certificate will be signed by CA. There is no official solution to SSL interceptions. For some time, all significant web browsers have had the built-in capability to generate public-private key pairs. SSL interception can be detected through an Interception Device, which would sit between the client and server. A false-negative is when an attacker gets classified as legitimate. A false-positive is when a legitimate connection gets classified as a threat. I believe that school / government / ISPs do not have the right to eavesdrop on our communications.</p>
