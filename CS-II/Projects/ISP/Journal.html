  <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
  <p>We got the NWS API linked up so you can view weather events on the App. We changed Map APIs from MapboxMaps to MapKit and made a LoginView.</p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenge</h3>
  <p>Between a combination of Mr. Ben being back and us realizing our deadline is coming up progress has resumed again on our ISP.</p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
  <p>We've had more progress this week than the last 2 weeks combined as everone needs to have 3 commits by Friday.</p>
  <h2>20 March 2023</h2>
  <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
  <p>This week there was no technical issues due to MVP Presentations</p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenge</h3>
  <p>We had to take time out working on the project this week due to preparing for the MVP Presentations</p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
  <p>We didn't fae any Interpersonal issues with the MVP Presentations</p>
  <h2>13 March 2023</h2>
  <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
  <p>We faced the issue of the .netrc file not verifying with our code. This took us a week to figure as we had to throughly read through the documentaion again. We ended up finding error was a small formatting error.</p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenge</h3>
  <p>None of us did any work on the ISP this week due to the .netrc file issue.</p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
  <p>None of us did any work on the ISP this week due to the .netrc file issue.</p>
  <h2>13 February 2023</h2>
  <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
  <p>We had a challenge with the installation of MapBox Packages in Xcode. This affected team members ability to run the app on their Macs. Fortunately, we found a solution to this issue. The issue was within the formatting of the .netrc file team members had to make.<p>
    <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
   <p> This week we faced the challenge of having MVP Presentations in class. This meant that we really couldn't work on the project. We had to work out of the class to progress the project. We were able to join Discord call to communicate and effectively make some progress.</p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenge</h3>
  <p>This week I had the challenge of getting team members to work. Most of the team has been lacking communication and hasn't been working on the project often. This leaves 3-4 people actually doing work and helping make progress. I found that assigning a GitHub issue to specific team member works the best.</p>
  <h2>16-Jan-2023</h2>
  <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
  <p>Team Members needed to create a file called .netrc. This file will allow us to have access to the API.</p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
  <p>This week we faced the challenge of a 4 day week. We didn't get much class time becuase on Tuesday we had a class discussion on ChatGPT. The following class we had a lecture over MySQL SELECT statments.
    <h3>Interpersonal Challenge</h3>
    <p>A teammate and I had an argument over who should build the JSON parsing for our app. We are both good at using JSON. We eventually came to the conclusion to let me handle the JSON parsing and he would work on anohter issue.
  <h2>9-Jan-2023</h2>
    <h3>Technical Challenge</h3>
  <p>This week we made sure everybody had access to the GitHub repository. We had little to none issues with this. A technical issue we faced was XCode on school Macs. Xcode failed to run on the school iMacs. We are trying to get the school's IT to resolve this issue but aren't sure if it will happen. Most members on our team have personal Macs. Those who don't can try to use a VM MacOS to run XCode.</p>
  <h3>Scheduling Challenge</h3>
  <p>We face the issue of having our members scattered through different periods for Computer Science 2. We have made a groupchat to make communication easy. We have not had a meeting yet due to team member's availabiltiy. We plan to have a meeting to discuss priorites, pick a logo, and brainstorm for UI design.</p>
  <h3>Interpersonal Challenge</h3>
  <p>An Interpersonal challenge we faced this week was the competition for the Product Manager Role. Comments were made in the groupchat degrading each other which made things worse. Eventually, the 4 people in the running slimmed down to 2. One team member realized that he was brilliant with GitHub and removed himself from the running. This left me as the only person in the running which meant that Product Manager was my role to keep.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>2-Jan-2023</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A technical challenge I faced this week was the linking of my GitHub account to XCode. It was a tricky process as it required a personal token rather than the account's password. I was able to generate a token and link to XCode. A scheduling challenge we faced was our team was spread among different classes. This meant we couldn't use class tinme to communicate and resolve issues and instead had to use digital communication. A Interpersonal challenge I faced this week was a Team Member's lack of knowledge in JSON. The Team Member had found an API that would give weather updates per coordinates given. The issue was the Team Member wasn't able to interpret the JSON output. I was able to help with my exisitng knowledge with APIs and JSON.</p>
