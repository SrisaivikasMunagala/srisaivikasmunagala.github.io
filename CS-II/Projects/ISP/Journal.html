  <h2>2-Jan-2023</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A technical challenge I faced this week was the linking of my GitHub account to XCode. It was a tricky process as it required a personal token rather than the account's password. I was able to generate a token and link to XCode. A scheduling challenge we faced was our team was spread among different classes. This meant we couldn't use class tinme to communicate and resolve issues and instead had to use digital communication. A Interpersonal challenge I faced this week was a Team Member's lack of knowledge in JSON. The Team Member had found an API that would give weather updates per coordinates given. The issue was the Team Member wasn't able to interpret the JSON output. I was able to help with my exisitng knowledge with APIs and JSON.</p>
