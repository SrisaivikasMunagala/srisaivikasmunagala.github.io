  <h1>Six Confused Men Corporation, SCMC Ltd.</h1>
  <p>Problem: Schools need a safe and efficient system to vet people entering their campus. It needs to ensure that students can get in easily, while preventing random people from entering undetected. Additionally, it needs to be cost effective, appease students and staff members, and prevent any potential intruders from stepping foot on campus.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Solution: We integrate RFID labels into the interior of student and staff IDs, then install a scanner on common entrance doors, which will scan for an ID when anyone walks in. This ensures that people walking in without an ID are caught and will immediately be reported to campus security to assess the issue. This prevents students from breaking code of conduct by entering the premises without IDs, as well as random people trying to enter.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Detailed Technical explanation: We will make use of RFID tags, which cost about 2 cents per tag, and integrate them into all student IDs. The scanners on the sides of common entrance doors will use a broken beam sensor to detect someone passing through, and will then scan for an RFID tag. If one is detected, nothing will happen. However, if one isn’t detected it will flash, alerting the security guard standing nearby to pull them aside. Visitor tags will not include RFID tags, requiring them to be pulled aside every time they enter the campus.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Target Market: Our target audience is large schools, with sizable campus populations that need cost-effective security measures to ensure their campus is well-protected from imposters and students are entering with IDs.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Competition: Our main competition is relatively primitive compared to our ideas. For example, the primary competition is hiring security guards to manually look for students' IDs as they enter the school building. This isn’t very effective as it’s subject to human error, and they cannot realistically check and look over all IDs of everyone coming on to campus. We know from first hand experience how easily this system can be evaded. Using old IDs, blank cards, or simply hiding the picture in a jacket, are all effective methods of evading human detection. Our scanners would wirelessly detect tags upon entrance to the school, eliminating the use of outdated IDs as well as people with no ID at all.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Revenue Streams: Our projected stream of revenue will mainly come from schools willing to pay to have our easy and practical system put in place to vet the people coming into the school. Additionally, we can make a profit off of any companies that need a high level of security put in place to ensure only employees can enter the building.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Marketing Activities: We will use Powerpoint presentations for school boards and school meetings to further demonstrate our product in action, and illustrate how it can better secure the school. We would also discuss how it could be implemented seamlessly at a very reasonably low cost. We could also do limited ads to targeted audiences on social media platforms like Google, Facebook, Youtube, and Twitter. Our marketing plan of action would be to push out our ads toward the end of the school year and before school starts, so that schools have enough time for the implementation of our system.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Expenses: The RFID system needs to be installed by a trained professional and each tag costs between .10$ and 1.50$.A scanner to read the RFID tags can cost between 300$-400$.</p>
